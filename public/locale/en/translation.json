            "p1": "After over 15 years of performing, teaching, and chasing perfection across 88 keys, I decided it was time for a different kind of code. Armed with two master’s degrees in classical music and a well-worn metronome, I traded Chopin for Python and stepped into the world of web development — where debugging is the new sight-reading.",
            "p2": "These days, instead of recitals and rehearsals, you'll find me building websites, writing clean code, and learning new technologies with the same discipline I once applied to Bach.
